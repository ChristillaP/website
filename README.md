This website is a simple single page website about the Women's Day celebrated on 8th March.Here the site contains 
images of the women achievers that runs on a slideshow of 3 seconds of each image.This also provides information about the Women's Day.


#### The things that I have learned in this iteration:
**08/03/2020**

Here I have learnt some concepts of *HTML* ,*CSS* and *JS* clearly like including the social media icons in the contact content, 
splitting the screen and slideshow. The main thing I learned is that the layout of the website should be planned first.

#### 10 Things need to be improved:
 
 -  The layout should be improved to look as professional.
 -  The name of the women achievers should be displayed on hovering the image.
 -  The contact section must be provided with more information.
 -  The social media icons provided should be redirected to its respective pages.
 -  The logo can be placed on the left side of the navbar.
 -  Links to different sites of events,competitions,resources etc should be added.
 -  The background color of the layout should be improved.
 -  The logo should not change its color on hovering.
 -  The images should be provided with good clarity.
 -  Instead of the image on right side ,some information can be provided. 
 
#### Some suggestions insisted by Olagmmal:
- Images can be more clear.
- Name of the women can be displayed.
- Some of the achievements of the women can also be displayed.
- Links to know more about the women achievers can be provided.
- Bootstrap icons can navigate to other pages.
- Some content can be given in place of "Happy Women's day" image.
- Change of background color on hovering in navbar can be improved.
- Change of background color of logo on hovering can be avoided.
